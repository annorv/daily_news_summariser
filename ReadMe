# Daily AI News Digest Bot 📰

This project sends you a **daily summary of the top 5 headlines in Artificial Intelligence**, straight to your inbox using GitHub Actions, Python, and a Transformer summarisation model (`t5-small`). No manual reading needed, just clean, bite-sized AI news to start your day.

---

## How It Works

1. **Fetch** AI-related headlines via a Google News RSS feed
2. **Summarise** the headlines using a Hugging Face Transformer (`t5-small`)
3. **Send** a nicely formatted daily email via Gmail SMTP
4. **Automate** the whole workflow using GitHub Actions (runs every day at 07:30 UTC)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your repo → ⚙️ Settings → **Secrets and variables → Actions** → **New repository secret**, and add:

| Secret Name  | Value                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `EMAIL_USER` | Your Gmail address                |
| `EMAIL_PASS` | App password (not your real pass) |
| `EMAIL_TO`   | Recipient email address           |

> 💡 **Use an App Password** from your Gmail settings (Google > Security > App passwords).

---

### 2. Install Dependencies (locally or in CI)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### ↻ 3. Schedule the Workflow (already set up)

Your GitHub Action (`send_news.yml`) runs **every day at 07:30 UTC**. You can also run it manually from the GitHub Actions tab.
